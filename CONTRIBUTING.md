## 🎵 Data Contribution Guidelines

### What Data We Accept

**✅ Good Contributions:**
- Historical Berghain/Panorama Bar performances (**November 2009 - ongoing**)
- Corrections with reliable, verifiable sources
- Missing artist performance records
- Event details from official Berghain sources
- Artist name normalization improvements (handling special characters: ¥, Ø, ø, À-ÿ)

**❌ What We Don't Accept:**
- Data from other venues or clubs
- Events outside our documentation period (pre-2009 or non-Berghain events)
- Speculative or unverified information
- Personal opinions presented as factual data
- Commercially sensitive or private information

### Source Requirements

All data corrections must include **credible, verifiable sources**:

1. **Primary Sources (Best):**
   - Official Berghain/Ostgut Ton announcements
   - Original event flyers and promotional materials
   - Berghain's official website archives
   - Resident Advisor event listings (contemporary)
   
2. **Secondary Sources (Good):**
   - Contemporary Techno magazine articles (from the event period)
   - Verified historical documentation
   - Official artist discographies mentioning Berghain performances
   - Music press coverage from the time

3. **Community Sources (Case-by-case):**
   - Personal attendance with specific, verifiable details
   - Multiple community corroborations
   - DJ/artist social media posts from the performance period

## 📝 Issue Guidelines

### Before Creating an Issue

1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Test the API** — verify it's actually a bug by testing endpoints
3. **Gather information** — API responses, error messages, timestamps
4. **Check multiple examples** — ensure it's not an isolated case

### Writing Good Issues

**Be Specific:**
- ❌ "Search doesn't work"
- ✅ "Artist search returns 500 error for queries containing special characters like 'Rødhåd'"

**Include Technical Details:**
- API endpoint used (e.g., `/api/artists?search=ben+klock`)
- Full response or error message
- Browser/client information if relevant
- Timestamp when the issue occurred

**Provide Context:**
- What were you trying to achieve?
- What did you expect to happen?
- What actually happened?

**Show Evidence:**
- Screenshots for UI issues
- JSON responses for API issues
- curl commands that reproduce the issue

## 🚀 API Usage Best Practices

### For Developers Using the API

**Respectful Usage:**
- **Cache responses** appropriately (our cache TTL: 2-24 hours depending on endpoint)
- **Handle rate limits** gracefully (we have generous limits but fair use applies)
- **Use appropriate endpoints** — `/api/artists/ranking` for rankings, `/api/artists` for search
- **Implement proper error handling** for network timeouts and API errors

**Performance Optimization:**
- Use `limit` parameters to control response size
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Consider using `/api/artists/by-name/{name}` for exact matches instead of search

**Technical Integration:**
- **CORS is enabled** for web applications
- **Response times** average <100ms for cached responses
- **Search normalization** handles special characters automatically

### Data Access Ethics

- **Respect the data** — this represents real artists and cultural history spanning 16+ years
- **Credit the source** — mention "Berghain Database" in your projects using this data
- **Share improvements** — if you find errors or inconsistencies, report them back
- **Non-commercial use** — respect the community nature of this project
- **Preserve context** — when using data, maintain the cultural significance of Berghain

## 🔍 Common Data Issues to Look For

### Artist Name Issues
- **Special character normalization** — Artists like "Rødhåd", "µ-Ziq", "Atom™"
- **Spelling variations** — Different spellings across events
- **Missing performances** — Artists you know performed but aren't in the database

### Event Data Issues
- **Date inconsistencies** — Wrong dates or formatting issues
- **Missing events** — Klubnacht sessions not recorded
- **URL problems** — Broken or incorrect Berghain event URLs
- **Artist count mismatches** — `total_artists` vs `actual_performances` discrepancies

### Performance Record Issues
- **Venue misattribution** — Artists listed for wrong floor (Berghain vs Panorama Bar)
- **Duplicate entries** — Same performance recorded multiple times
- **Missing performances** — Known performances not in database
