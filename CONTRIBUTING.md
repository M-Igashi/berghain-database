## 🎵 Data Contribution Guidelines

### What Data We Accept

**✅ Good Contributions:**
- Historical Berghain/Panorama Bar performances (2004-2009)
- Corrections with reliable sources
- Additional artist metadata (country, genre)
- Event details from official sources

**❌ What We Don't Accept:**
- Data from other venues
- Events after 2009 (different project scope)
- Speculative or unverified information
- Personal opinions as data

### Source Requirements

All data corrections must include **credible sources**:

1. **Primary Sources (Best):**
   - Official Berghain announcements
   - Original event flyers
   - Ostgut Ton records
   
2. **Secondary Sources (Good):**
   - Resident Advisor event listings
   - Contemporary techno magazine articles
   - Verified historical documentation

3. **Personal Sources (Case-by-case):**
   - Personal attendance (with specific details)
   - DJ social media posts from the time
   - Community knowledge (multiple corroborations)

## 📝 Issue Guidelines

### Before Creating an Issue

1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Check the API** - make sure it's actually a bug
3. **Gather information** - API responses, screenshots, etc.

### Writing Good Issues

- **Be specific** - "Search doesn't work" vs "Search returns 500 error for queries over 50 characters"
- **Include details** - API endpoints, parameters, timestamps
- **Show evidence** - screenshots, JSON responses, error messages
- **Be respectful** - remember humans maintain this project

## 🚀 API Usage Best Practices

### For Developers Using the API

- **Cache responses** where appropriate
- **Handle rate limits** gracefully (though we're quite generous)
- **Use appropriate endpoints** - don't query `/api/artists` when you need `/api/artists/ranking`
- **Report issues** if you find bugs or inconsistencies

### Data Access Ethics

- **Respect the data** - this represents real artists and cultural history
- **Credit the source** - mention the Berghain Database in your projects
- **Share improvements** - if you find errors, report them back
- **Non-commercial use** - don't monetize the data without permission
